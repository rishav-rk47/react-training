BrowserRouter
BrowserRouter is a router implementation that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState, and the popstate event) 
to keep your UI in sync with the URL. It is the top-level component that needs to wrap your entire application or the part of 
the app where you want to use routing.

Routes
Routes is a new component introduced in React Router v6, which replaces the Switch component used in previous versions.
 It iterates over all its children Route elements and renders the first one that matches the current location.

Route
Route is used to define the mapping between the URL path and the component that should be rendered. 
It can also define nested routes and route parameters.
