NPX is a package runner tool that comes with NPM (version 5.2.0 and higher).
 It allows developers to execute Node.js packages directly without needing to install them globally. 
 NPX simplifies the process of running CLI tools and scripts that are not necessarily part of your project's dependencies.

Key Features:
    Run Packages: Execute any Node.js package without prior installation.
    Temporary Execution: Run packages temporarily, which are removed after execution.
    Local Execution: Execute local project binaries.


Usage Example:
To execute a package: npx <package-name>
To run a package from a specific version: npx <package-name>@<version>

what happen if we don't use npx to run create-react-app, we'll need to install create-react-app globally on our system first.

step: 
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-new-app


Without npx: we need to globally install create-react-app and then run it to create a new project.
With npx: we can directly run the command without prior installation, ensuring you use the latest version and avoiding global installations.
