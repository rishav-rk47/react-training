Key concept of redux:
 1. store : hold state of our application
 2. action : An object that describes what happened and has a "type" property
 3. reducer : A function that determines how the state changes in response to an action

Setup redux in our application : several ways
1. without extra library that gives boiler plate code// depricated
2. with extra library that gives boiler plate code


to use library we need: redux and react-redux
cmd: 

npm install redux react-redux 

latest way:
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

1. Create a Slice:
A slice is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature of our app.

2. configure store
3. provide store
4. use redux hooks

...........
Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux setup and reduces boilerplate.
Slices combine actions and reducers in a single file.
configureStore from Redux Toolkit sets up the store with good defaults.
useSelector and useDispatch hooks provide a simpler way to interact with the Redux store.
